1) Verification Plan:
- Check value of C = 00000 after reset = 1 
- Apply values A = 0001 and B = 0001 and check C = 00000 without clock
- Apply clock 
- Apply all values of A and B from 0000 to 1111 along with ADD and SUB Op codes, check value only after clock goes high
- Check value of C = 00000 after reset = 1 when C has some value after addition of two numbers
- Check value of C = 00000 after applying A = 1111 and B = 0101 along with Bitwise invert op code
- Check value of C = 00000 after applying values from 0000 to 1111 for B and A = ~B along with reduction or op code
- Apply reset = 1

2) Advantages: Testing is fast, internal bugs are tested
   Disadvantages: Only the module is tested, individual parts are tested

3) Advantages: Entire system is verified, only initial and final outputs need to be tested 
   Disadvantages: Testing is slow, and internal bugs aren't tested
